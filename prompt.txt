Build an Android app called “CalcVault” that shows a fully functional calculator UI on the front, and secretly acts as a secure file vault to hide videos, images, and documents.

Key requirements:

Offline-first: All vault data stored locally, no server or cloud sync.

Calculator front: Full basic arithmetic, clean UI.

Hidden vault: Trigger via secret PIN or long-press “=”, with PIN/biometric authentication. Files encrypted with AES-256 and stored in app-private storage.

Permissions: Only SAF (file access) + biometric. No internet needed for vault.

Google Ads integration:

Integrate Google AdMob SDK.

Use Google’s sample Ad Unit IDs for testing first. In release build, replace them with your own AdMob App ID and Ad Unit IDs.

Show Banner Ads at the bottom of the calculator screen.

Show Interstitial Ads only on safe flows (e.g., when user exits the vault or after completing an import/export).

Never show ads inside the vault’s sensitive screens (file browsing, PIN entry, encryption/decryption).

Ads must follow Google Play Ads Policy: no deceptive placement, no accidental clicks.

Privacy & compliance:

Provide a Privacy Policy stating that ads are served via Google AdMob and user data is not uploaded elsewhere.

Ask for user consent (GDPR/CCPA) if required.

Deliverables:

Android Studio project with AdMob integrated.

Test ads enabled by default.

Clear instructions in README for replacing test IDs with real Ad Unit IDs before release.

Vault remains secure and unaffected by ads.
