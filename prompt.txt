Build an Android app called “CalcVault” that shows a fully functional calculator UI on the front, and secretly acts as a secure file vault to hide videos, images, and documents.

Key requirement: The app must work entirely offline, with no server, no cloud sync, no internet dependency. All data is stored and encrypted locally on the device.

Calculator front: Same as before (basic arithmetic, clean UI).

Hidden vault:

Trigger: secret PIN or long-press on “=”.

Authentication: PIN + optional biometric.

Local storage only: All files are imported via Android’s Storage Access Framework, encrypted with AES-256, and stored in the app’s private directory.

No server calls: Disable internet permission in the manifest (<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" tools:node="remove"/>).

Metadata (file name, type, date) stored in local Room database, encrypted.

Export/decrypt only when user explicitly chooses a location.

Security:

Keys derived from PIN and stored securely in Android Keystore.

Auto-lock vault after inactivity.

Wipe decrypted temp files immediately after use.

Permissions: Only SAF for file access + biometric. No network permissions.

Deliverables: Android Studio project, README explaining offline-only design, and test cases for vault operations.

Why this matters
Privacy: Nothing leaves the device.

Play Store compliance: No unnecessary permissions.

Simplicity: No backend to maintain.
